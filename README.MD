# Homework 2: Custom Keyboard with Storyboard

## Due
Wednesday, September 23 at 11:59 PM

## Description
In last week's homework, you explored Swift in the Playground. Playground is a great place to test small things out, but it's now time to build your first app! In this assignment, we will be exploring Xcode even further the through the Storyboard. As discussed in lecture, Storyboard is a powerful way to sketch out designs and translate it to working code. 

Our app will be a custom keyboard -- think emojis, but with our own buttons and interactions. Your job will be to fill out the code to successfully link up interactions between the user and the keyboard. 

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. ** Add to KeyboardViewController.swift and Keyboard.xib **
4. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository.

## Requirements
1. Must have a "Next Keyboard button"
    - This is done for you already, but feel free to change the image,text,etc
2. Must have a "Return button"
3. Must have a "Delete button"
4. Must have various "input buttons"
    - Examples of inputs: ASCII Text, GIFS, Unicode, Emojis, etc.
